# MERN-PLAYGROUND

## Simple application to practice CRUD operations and deployment to Heroku.

### Technologies 
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Node

#### This is an application purely for me toy around with these technologies. Specifically, I would like to practice deploying applications to Heroku, Git commands and workflows, and getting the Frontend to talk to the Backend, and vice versa. 

#### For the past couple of months, I have dedicated most of my time to studying and practicing implementation of Data Structures. While I have grown significantly in that area of engineering, I have not practiced deploying projects. As such, this playground will serve to deploy a simplistic web page for myself. I hope this project does not look employer-ready, for that mentality has held me back from deploying projects in the first place. If, however, you are a potential employer reading this right now, feel free to contact me rmpcoding@gmail.com . I understand the process of learning, and I will be an invaluable employee to your company granted we fit.
